<h1>ABOUT PUP</h1>
<div id="Pc">THE PUP QUEZON CITY CAMPUS</div>
<p> formerly PUP Commonwealth Campus, is a 1.9-hectare forested land area and was assigned, transferred and endorsed to the POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES as ASSIGNEE by the HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT COORDINATING COUNCIL-NATIONAL GOVERNMENT CENTER HOUSING COMMITTEE (HUDCC-NGCHC), a government entity created by Executive Order No. 90 and with expanded functions under RA 7279 and HOME INSURANCE AND GUARANTY CORPORATION (HIGC) as ASSIGNOR, a government owned and controlled corporation created under RA 580 and presently located at Don Fabian Street, Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City. Thru the concerted efforts of Dr. Ofelia M. Carague, PUP Executive Vice President and Mr. Jaime E. Varela, Project Administrator, NGCHP, a DEED OF ASSIGNMENT was executed and signed by ATTY. DIONISIO C. DELA SERNA, HUDCC-NGCHC Chairman, MR. WILFREDO F. HERNANDEZ, HIGC President and DR. ZENAIDA A. OLONAN, University President on 24 March 1997  with a sole objective to “establish a branch or an extension of PUP at the National Government Center with a mandate to bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban poor communities of Quezon City, with priority given to those from the NGCHP.” </p>
<p>Prior to this, an execution of DEED OF DONATION, whereby two (2) halls - ROTHLEHNER AND MISEREOR Building today in honor to their generosity and benevolence as funding-donors in which the two buildings were built  - were donated to PUP for its purposes entered into by and between the  SENTRO SA IKAUUNLAD NG KASANAYAN at HANAPBUHAY (SIKHAY) – an association duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) represented by its President, Rev. Fr. Joel E. Tabora, S.J. and PUP on 26 February 1997.</p>
<p>Upon its opening in 1997 offering a Master in Educational Management under the Open University System, PUP Quezon City also offered Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and a 1-Year Certificate in Information Communication Technology on its first year of formal operations during the Academic Year 1998-1999. As part of the donated property, the two original structures known as Rothlehner and Misereor  Halls today became integral parts of the campus and now served as classrooms, Learning Resource Center, and academic and administrative offices for students and faculty members.</p>
